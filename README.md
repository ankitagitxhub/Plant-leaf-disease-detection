Plant Leaf Disease Detection using CNN
-Project Overview

This project focuses on automatic classification of plant leaf diseases using image-based deep learning techniques. The system analyzes images of plant leaves and identifies whether they are healthy or affected by a specific disease.

The goal is to support farmers and agricultural experts by providing a fast, cost-effective, and accurate tool for early disease detection, which helps in improving crop yield and reducing losses.

üîç Problem Statement

Traditional disease detection in crops depends on manual inspection.

It is time-consuming, costly, and prone to error.

Lack of timely diagnosis leads to reduced productivity and financial losses.

An automated solution is required to make disease classification scalable, reliable, and efficient.

-Objectives

Build a deep learning-based image classification system for plant diseases.

Train and evaluate a CNN model on multi-class crop datasets.

Provide an easy-to-use interface for users to upload leaf images and receive predictions.

Achieve high accuracy with reduced false detections.
